## Abstract
- We tested a low‐cost, **drug‐repositioning strategy to identify candidate epilepsy drugs** that are already FDA‐approved and might be immediately tested in epilepsy patients
- Biopsies of **spiking and nonspiking hippocampal brain tissue from six patients** with unilateral mesial temporal lobe epilepsy were analyzed by **RNA‐Seq**.
- The transcriptome profiles were correlated with L1000 data, a cell lines data treated with FDA-approved drugs.
- Identified **689 DEGs** from RNA-seq (spiking vs. nonspiking biopsies) --> **148 DEGs of which were previously cited** in articles mentioning seizures or epolepsy.
- Matched with Protein-Protein interactions and formed **3 clusters** with associated GO-terms including myelination, protein ubiquitinatio, and neuronal migration.
